## Description

The purpose of my website is to help people relieve stress by allowing users to write in detail about their feelings and thoughts related to stressful events. When I became a freshman at CMU, I usually found myself living with a constant stream of worries. While this might not be a cure for everything, I found that writing things down was a scientifically proved way to reduce stress and indeed helped me handle it quite more effectively. So that is a small trigger for me to make this small web application for people to write out their stress too on the 'sticky notes' and get some practical stress management techniques. As a reminder, the caption above the sticky notes gives a heads-up of the users'state of mind and provides support hotline when the input is extremely negative, though the sentiment analysis API I used to enable this feature is not performing very raliably and there is room for improvement on that given more time. 

In terms of the design, I tried to create a form of narrative to make visitors feel connected as much as possible. An orange avatar, typing animation, and dynamic caption were used all for the same purpose of enhancing storytelling on the website. Many elements in the first iteration were removed, such as the blue wavy nav decoration and hand-drawn style sticky note border, to make the website design look more modern and simple, especially thinking that the major goal here is to help people offload cognitive burden and de-stress. 

## Using the Website

**Navigation Bar**
* Click on the texts to navigate to one of the tree sections
 
**Home Page**
* The home page is basically to prompt users to 'share what's on their mind' > click 'Start' button to start journaling

**StickStress Page**
* Click 'Add note' button to create new sticky notes and delete those that are no longer 'on your mind' by clicking the bin icon
* Typing in each note to input information about your thoughts and feelings, the caption changes accordingly as a response.
